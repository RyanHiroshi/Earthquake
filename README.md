# Earthquake

This project mainly purposed to predict earthquake magnitude based on earthquake depth. <br />

# Introduction

This project will predict earthquake magnitude based on earthquake depth by using Linear Regression. <br/>
These project can also help you to view earthquake position with shiny <br/>
shiny::runGitHub("RyanHiroshi/Earthquake") #Type in Rstudio to run <br />
Hover to see the earthquake magnitude <br />
<br />
We are trying to make the linear regression in the shiny but the project haven't finished it yet.

# Linear Regression
The main purpose of linear regression is to model a continuous variable Y as a mathematical funtion of one or more X variable(s). The Linear Regression itself establish a linear relationship between the predictor variable and
the response variable so we can use the formula to estimate the value of the response when we can only use the predictors (Xs) values that known.


# R packages used
shiny <br />
shinydashboard <br />
leaflet <br />
DAAG <br/>

# DAAG (Data Analisys and Graphic)
In this Project we are using Daag to demonstrate probility of a real effect changes with changes in the prior proportion of real effects. We use the this function (DAAG) to make the data itself can generated into another visual (which is the map). <br/>
